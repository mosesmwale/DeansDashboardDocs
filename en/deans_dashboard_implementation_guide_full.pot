Before a school can implement a dashboard, it needs access to high-quality, routinely collected, individual-level data. While data are usable in any easily accessed format, having data in a digital system is ideal, even in electronic spreadsheets. Pilot institutions found that setting up the dashboard’s data and reports was relatively easy once the DHIS 2 interface was mastered. After a representative of an institution has been trained to configure and utilize DHIS 2, few resources are required to continue and expand its usefulness."

Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations, e.g. a Country or MoH unit (the root) might have e.g. 8 parent units (provinces), and each province again ( at level 2) might have 10-15 districts as their children. Normally the health facilities will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5)."

When designing the hierarchy the number of children for any organisational unit may indicate the usefulness of the structure, e.g. having one or more 1-1 relationships between two levels is not very useful as the values will be the same for the child and the parent level. On the other extreme a very high number of children in the middle of the hierarchy (e.g. 50 districts in a province) might call for an extra level to be added in between to increase the usefulness of data analysis. The lowest level, the health facilities will often have a large number of children (10-60), but for other levels higher up in the hierarchy approx. 5-20 children is recommended. Too few or too many children might indicate that a level should be removed or added."

In some contexts this is referred to an indicator, but in DHIS 2 we call this unit of collection and analysis a <emphasis role=\"italic\">data element</emphasis>. The data element often represents a count of something, and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. \"BCG doses given\" or \"Malaria cases\". When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented it is the data elements or expressions built upon data elements that describes the WHAT of the data. As such the data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is collected, but more importantly how the data values are represented in the database, which again decides how data can be analysed and presented."

Some common categories are Age and Gender, but any category can be added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element's name and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system, and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of this dimension, but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the WHAT dimension). Changes to data elements and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive and careful steps in the database design process."

msgid "One best practice when designing data elements is to think of data elements as a unit of data analysis and not just as a field in the data collection form. Each data element lives on its own in the database, completely detached from the collection form, and reports and other outputs are based on data elements and expressions/formulas composed of data elements and not the data collection forms. So the data analysis needs should drive the process, and not the look an feel of the data collection forms. A simple rule of thumb is that the name of the data element must be able to stand on its own and describe the data value also outside the context of its collection form. E.g. a data element name like \"Total referrals\" makes sense when looking at it in either the \"RCH\" form or the \"OPD\" form, but on its own it does not uniquely describe the phenomena (who are being referred?), and should in stead be called \"Total referrals from Maternity\" or \"Total referrals from OPD\". Two different data elements with different meanings, although the field on the paper form might only say \"Total referrals\" since the user of the form will always know where these referrals come from. In a database or a repository of data elements this context is no longer valid and therefore the names of the data elements become so important in describing the data."

While data elements represent the raw data (counts) being collected the indicators represent formulas providing coverage rates, incidence rates, ratios and other formula-based units of analysis. An indicator is made up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator \"BCG coverage &lt;1 year\" is defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator (\"BCG doses given to children under 1 year\") and a denominator (\"Target population under 1 year\"). The indicator \"DPT1 to DPT3 drop out rate\" is a formula of 100 % x (\"DPT1 doses given\"- \"DPT3 doses given\") / (\"DPT1 doses given\")."

DHIS2 is structured so that the organisational unit hierarchy is a geographical hierarchy, and the GIS module depends on this. Non-geographical hierarchies are discouraged, and would better to be represented through the use of organisational unit groups. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health or a country) and any number of levels and nodes below.

Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and hence they work offline. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region. For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline, say at the health facility level) to another one say at the district level where the data would need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to fulfill these needs."

Then all data collected on measles immunisation would have to be disaggregated along these to options. In addition to this you might be interested in knowing how many of these children who were under 1 year or above 1 year of age. If so you can add an Age dimension to the data element with the two possible options \"&lt;1 y\" and \"&gt;1 y\". This implies further detail on the data collection process.

Expanding the report to include data from other programs or larger themes of health data would mean more groups to such a group set dimension, like \"Malaria\", \"Reproductive Health\", \"Stocks\". For this example you would create a data element group set called \"Programme\" (or whatever name you find appropriate), and to represent the different programmes in this dimension you would define data elements groups called \"EPI\", \"Nutrition\", \"Malaria\", \"Reproductive health\" and so on, and add all these groups to the \"Programme\" group set. To link or tag the data element \"Measles doses given\" to such a dimension you must (in our example) add it to the \"EPI\" group. Which groups you add \"Measles doses given\" to does not affect how health facilities collect the data, but adds more possibilities to your data analysis.

This has implications for how e.g. coverage indicators are calculated as the full annual population will be used as denominator value even when doing monthly reports. If you want to look at an estimated annual coverage value for a given month then you will have the option of setting the indicator to \"Annualised\" which means that a monthly coverage value will be multiplied by 12, a quarterly value by 4 etc. The annualised indicator feature can therefore be used to mimic the use of monthly population estimates."

Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values), repetition of annual data (the same population data reported every month) or even indicator values such as coverage rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in DHIS every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated values such as the ones mentioned above.

It has two dimensions, the first column with the ANC activity or service (1st visit, IPT 2nd dose etc) and the 2nd and 3rd column which represent the place where the service was given with the two options fixed and outreach. Since the ANC service is the key phenomena to analyse here and often there is a need for looking at e.g. total of ANC 1st visits no matter where (fixed+outreach) it makes a lot of sense to use this dimension as the data element dimension. So all items on the first column from 1st ANC visit to 2nd IPT dose given by TBA are represented as individual data elements. The place dimension is represented as a data element category (from now on referred to as category) with the name \"fixed/outreach\" with the two data element category options (from now on catoptions) \"fixed\" and \"outreach\". There is no other dimension here so we add a new catcombo with the name \"Fixed/Outreach\" with one category \"Fixed/Outreach\". Strictly speaking there is another dimension in this table, and that is the at PHU or by TBA dimension which is repeated for the two doses of IPT, but since none of the other ANC services listed have this dimension it does not seem like a good idea to separate out two data elements from this table and give them another catcombo with both fixed/outreach and at PHU/by TBA. reusing the same catcombo for all the ANC services makes more sense since it will be easier to look at these together in reports etc. and also the fact that there is not much to loose by repeating the at PHU or by TBA information as part of the data element name when it is only for four data elements in a table of totally 11 data elements."

msgid "<emphasis role=\"bold\">DELIVERY table.</emphasis> This table is more tricky as it has a lot of information and you can see that not all the rows have the same columns (some columns are merged and a one field is grayed out/disabled.). If we start by looking at the first column \"Deliveries assisted by\" that seems to be one dimension, but only down to the \"Untrained TBA\" row, as the remaining three rows are not related to who assisted the delivery at all. Another dimension is the place of delivery, either In PHU or in Community as stated on the top column headings. These deliveries are further split into the outcome of the delivery, whether it is a live or still birth, which seems to be another dimension. So if we disregard the three bottom rows for a moment there seems to be 3 dimensions here, 1) assisted by, 2) place of delivery, and 3) delivery outcome. The key decision to make is what to use as the data element, the main dimension, the total that you will most often use and want easily available in reports and data analysis. We ended up using the outcome dimension as total live births is a very commonly used value in many indicators (maternal mortality ratio, births attended by skilled health personnel etc.). In this case the Assisted By dimension could also have been used without any problem, but the added value of easily getting the total live births information was the decisive point for us. This means that from this table (or sub-table of row 1 to 6) there are only two data elements; \"Live births\" and \"Still births\". Then there are two more dimensions, the \"PHU/Community\" with its two options and a \"Births attended by\" with options (\"MCH Aides\", \"SECHN\", \"Midwives\", \"CHO\", \"Trained TBA\", \"Untrained TBA\"). These two categories make up the catcombo \"Births\" which is assigned to the two data elements \"Live births\" and \"Still births\". Considering the final three rows of the delivery table we can see that \"Complicated Deliveries\" does not have the assisted by dimension, but has the place and the outcome. \"Low birth weight\" also does not have the assisted by dimension and not the outcome either. The LLITN given after delivery does not have any additional dimension at all. Since not any of the three rows can share catcombo with any other row we decided to represent these fields as so called flat data elements, meaning data elements with no categories at all, and simply adding the additional information from the column headings to the data element name, and therefore ended up with the following data elements with the default (same as none) catcombo; \"Complicated deliveries in PHU live birth\", \"Complicated deliveries in PHU still births\", \"Complicated deliveries in community live birth\", \"Complicated deliveries in community still births\", \"Low birth weight in PHU\", \"Low birth weight in community\", and \"LLITN given after delivery\"."

There is fixed/outreach dimension here, but there is also the In school place that is only applied to the Non-Pregnant, or more correctly to any of the two as the school immunisation is done whether the girls are pregnant or not. We consulted the program people behind the form and found out that it would be OK to register all school TT immunisations as non-pregnant, which simplifies the model a bit since we can reuse the \"TT1\" to \"TT5\" data elements. So we ended up with a new category called \"TT place\" with the three options (Fixed, Outreach, In School), and another category called \"Pregnant/Non-pregnant\" with two options. The new catcombo \"TT\" is then a combination of these two and applied to the 5 TT data elements. Since we agreed to put all In Schools immunisations under Non-pregnant in means that the combination of options (Pregnant+In School) will never be used in any data entry form, and hence become a possible optioncombo, which is OK. As long as the form is custom designed then you can choose which combinations of options to use or not, and therefore it is not a problem to have such passive or unused catoptions. Having school as one option in the TT place category simplifies the model and therefore we thought it was worth it. The alternative would be to create 5 more data elements for \"TT1 in school\" ... \"TT5 in school\", but then it would be a bit confusing to add these together with the \"TT1\" ...\"TT5\" plus TT catcombo. Having school as a place in the TT place category makes it a lot easier to get the total of TT1.. TT5 vaccines given, which are the most important numbers and most often used values for data analysis."

msgid "<emphasis role=\"bold\">Complications of early and late pregnancy and labour tables</emphasis> We treat these two tables as one, and will explain why. These two tables are a bit confusing and not the best design. The major data coming out of these tables are the pregnancy complications and the maternal deaths. These are the major things for data analysis. And then there is further detail on the cause of the complication or death (the first column in both tables), as well as a place of death (in PHU or community), and a outcome of the complication (when its not a death) that can be either Managed at PHU or Referred. We decided to create two data elements for these two tables; \"Pregnancy complications\", and \"Maternal Deaths\", and two category combinations, one for each of the data elements. For the Pregnancy Complications data element there are two additional dimensions, the cause of the complication (the combined list of the first column in the two tables) and the outcome (managed at PHU or Referred), so these are the categories and options that make up that category combination. For the \"Maternal deaths\" data element the same category with the different causes are used and then another category for the place of death (in PHU or In community). This way the two data elements can share one category and it will be easy to derive the total number of pregnancy complications and maternal deaths. While the list of complications on the paper form is divided into two (early and late/labour) you can see that e.g. the malaria in 2nd and 3rd trimester are listed under early, but in fact are for a later phase of the pregnancy. There is no clear divide between early and late complications in the form, and therefore we gave up trying to make this distinction in the database."

This way it will be easy to get the total number of family planning clients which is the major value to look at in data analysis, and from there you can easily get the details on method or how many new clients there are."

Based on an analysis of the findings from a global network of software development and implementation, an approach to preserve the importance of local user participation in distributed development is presented. Through practical examples, we discuss the applicability of the CBPP model for software production aimed at improving the public health sector in the South, and propose the concept of a snowflake topology."
